# Evoland TAS

## Setup

* Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* The TAS will use sane defaults, but if required, it's possible to specify run parameters by copying the contents of `config.yaml.example` to `config.yaml` and edit its contents.

## Perform run

* Run `py main.py`

## For development

* Run `pip install pre-commit` and `pre-commit install` to install pre-commit hooks.
