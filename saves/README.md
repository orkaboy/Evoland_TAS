# Saves

Copy the save you want into the Evoland Steam save folder and rename it to a file in the range `slot0.sav` - `slot4.sav`.

To load a save, set `saveslot` in `config.yaml` to the save nr + 1 (so `1` for `slot0.sav`) and set the checkpoint to the original name of the save. Do not include the index (`overworld`, not `1_overworld`). Run the TAS as usual.
